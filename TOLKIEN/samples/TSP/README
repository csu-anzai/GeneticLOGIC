Solving symmetric TSP using GA with edge recombination
======================================================

1. The code for edge recombination is adapted from Whitley's GENITOR.

2. This directory contains two GA programs to solve TSP :

   i) "Traditional" GA :- roulette wheel crossover, 0.1 generation gap
       files used :
        main.cc
        edge.cc
        tsp.cc
        tour.cc
        gatsp.cc
        SIntVec.cc

	compiled program is named as GATSP

   ii) GENITOR-like GA
       files used :
	genitor.cc
        edge.cc
        tsp.cc
        tour.cc
        gatsp.cc
        SIntVec.cc

	compiled program is named as genitor

3. Two small standard test problems are included : ATT48 and LIN105.  You
   may obtain more from TSPLIB obtainable from Internet.

4. The programs are called as follows :

	GATSP tour_file [config_file]
	genitor tour_file [config_file]

	the tour_file is a file containing the coordinates of the cities.
	You will find two tour files, att48.tsp and lin318.tsp, in the directory.

5. The file config.fil is a configuration file containing the parameters
   such as popsize, mutation rate, etc.  If the configuration file 
   is not given, a standard set of parameters will be used.
	
6. Two files, stat.out and profile.out, are generated by the programs.

   stat.out logged for each generation the minimum, mean, maximum, and 
   SD of the population.  

   profile.out output the best tour length obtained at an interval 
   of one hundred tours generated.
