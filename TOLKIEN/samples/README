Sample programs constructed using TOLKIEN
-----------------------------------------

This directory contains several sample programs :

1. DEJONG
=========
DeJong's classical test problems.
Calling convention : dejong [function number]

2. MAZE
========
A classifier system application for a maze navigator.
Calling convention : Maze [number of runs]
		     Maze 100 will cause the navigator to travel
		     the maze a hundred times.
A file trails.out will be produced which logged to paths taken.
A file mpcls.csf will be produced which logged the classifiers.

3. MPCLS
========
A classifier system application for a simple multiplexer.
Calling convention : mpcls [number of trials]
A file result.out will be produced.

4. ROYALRD 
==========
Holland's royal road functions.

5. TSP 
======
Using Whitley's Edge Recombination to solve symmetric TSPs.

6. Multimodal
=============
A GA with deterministic crowding for multimodal function optimizations.
