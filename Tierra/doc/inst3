Instset #3  Based on a design suggested and implemented by Tom Ray.  This
    includes certain features of the RPN Hewlett-Packard calculator.

No Operations: 2

nop0
nop1

Memory Movement: 11

rollu  (roll registers up:   AX = DX, BX = AX, CX = BX, DX = CX)
rolld  (roll registers down: AX = BX, BX = CX, CX = DX, DX = AX)
enter  (AX = AX, BX = AX, CX = BX, DX = CX, DX is lost)
exch   (AX = BX, BX = AX)
movdi  (move from BX to ram [AX])
movid  (move from ram [BX] to AX)
movii  (move from ram [BX] to ram [AX])
push   (push AX onto stack)
pop    (pop from stack into AX)
put    (write AX to output buffer, three modes:
         #ifndef ICC: write AX to own output buffer
         #ifdef ICC:  write AX to input buffer of cell at address BX,
           or, if template, write AX to input buffers of all creatures within
           PutLimit who have the complementary get template)
get    (read AX from input buffer)

Calculation: 9

inc    (increment AX)
dec    (decrement AX)
add    (AX = BX + AX, BX = CX, CX = DX))
sub    (AX = BX - AX, BX = CX, CX = DX))
zero   (zero AX)
not0   (flip low order bit of AX)
not    (flip all bits of AX)
shl    (shift left all bits of AX)
rand   (place random number in AX)

Instruction Pointer Manipulation: 5

ifz  (if   AX == 0 execute next instruction, otherwise, skip it)
iffl (if flag == 1 execute next instruction, otherwise, skip it)
jmp  (jump to template, or if no template jump to address in AX)
jmpb (jump back to template, or if no template jump back to address in AX)
call (push IP + 1 onto the stack; if template, jump to complementary templ)

Biological and Sensory: 5

adr    (search outward for template, put address in AX, template size in BX,
           and offset in CX, start search at offset +- BX)
adrb   (search backward for template, put address in AX, template size in BX,
           and offset in CX, start search at offset - BX)
adrf   (search forward for template, put address in AX, template size in BX,
           and offset in CX, start search at offset + BX)
mal    (allocate amount of space specified in BX, prefer address at AX,
           if AX < 0 use best fit, place address of allocated block in AX)
divide (cell division, the IP is offset by AX into the daughter cell, the
           values in the four CPU registers are transferred from mother to
           daughter, but not the stack. If !CX genome will be ejected from
           the simulator)
