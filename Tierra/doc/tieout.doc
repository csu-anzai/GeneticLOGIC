PURPOSE:

   This document describes a software tool that aids in the analysis of 
 log files from the Tierra Artificial Life Simulation (1).  Given a log file,
 and 2 parameters, TIEOUT will produce an X,Y list from the log.

THE INTERFACE:

   The TIEOUT user interface is a simple command line driven system. 
 All of the menu options are Case Sensative (Turn Caps Lock Off).
 Running TIEOUT with no options will produce the following help message:
   
> syntax:  tieout infile xfield yfield 

 From this we see that you must provide at least 3 parameters:

   - infile , the first param, specifying an existing path and tierra log
     filename ( eg tierra.log ).  A '-' in place of a filename, indicates
     that TIEOUT should use the keyboard (stdin) as input.
   - xfield , the second param, specifying the 2 character symbol to be
     used as first (X) search field ( eg 'ie' ).
   - yfield , the third param, specifying the 2 character symbol to be
     used as second (Y) search field ( eg 'ex', 'as' ). Due to its chaotic
     nature, the 'ex' field may ONLY be used as the seond param.

 Normally, the output list is printed to the screen (stdout).  Some examples 
 of use are:

> tieout tierra.log ie ex > ex_out

   The example above will produce a list of all Tierra gene extractions,
 a very useful measure of diversity.  This list is redirected to a file
 called ex_out.

> tieout - ie as > as_out < tierra.log

   The example above will produce a list of the Average Size of the genomes,
 as a function of time.  Note that we use the '-' as the filname here, only
 as an example.  In general the '-' infile is best when using TIEOUT
 in a complex stream piping situation.

> tieout tierra.log ie as 
>
> "ie_as
> 0 80
> 1 79
> 2 79
> 3 73
> 4 67
> 5 60
> 6 59

   The example above will produce a list of the Average Size of the genes,
 but this time, the X,Y data is simply printed to the screen.  The first
 column (X) is the values of 'ie' ( millions of instructions executed),
 and the second (Y) column is the next occurence of 'as' found after the 'ie'.
 In the special case of 'ex' as the Y parameter, if another extraction is
 found before the next X parameter is, the previous value of X is used in the
 printing.  This allows for multiple extraction per million.  No other
 parameter is recorded this frequently.

   Note the label is a concatenation of the X and Y parameters.  Also note
 the blank line before the label.  This allows the output to be easily sent
 to a graphing tool ( eg: xgraph ).
