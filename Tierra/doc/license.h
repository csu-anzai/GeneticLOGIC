 * If you purchased this program on disk, thank you for your support.  If 
 * you obtained the source code through the net or friends, we invite you to
 * contribute an amount that represents the program's worth to you.  You may
 * make a check in US dollars payable to Virtual Life, and mail the check to
 * one of the two addresses listed below.
 * 
 * This license agreement has two parts: 
 * 
 * 1) The source code, documentation, and the beagle.exe file can be freely
 *    distributed.
 * 
 * 2) The executables (the .exe files in DOS) are for sale and can not be
 *    freely distributed (with the exception of the beagle.exe file).
 *    Executables (binaries) on any platform (Unix, Mac, Amiga, DOS, etc.)
 *    can not be freely distributed.
 * 
 * These two points are elaborated below:
 * 
 * 1) The source code, documentation, and the beagle.exe file can be freely
 *    distributed.
 * 
 * The source code and documentation is copyrighted, all rights reserved.
 * The source code, documentation, and the beagle.exe file may be freely
 * copied and distributed without fees (contributions welcome), subject to
 * the following restrictions:
 * 
 * - This notice may not be removed or altered.
 * 
 * - You may not try to make money by distributing the package or by using the
 *   process that the code creates.
 * 
 * - You may not prevent others from copying it freely.
 * 
 * - You may not distribute modified versions without clearly documenting your
 *   changes and notifying the principal author.
 * 
 * - The origin of this software must not be misrepresented, either by
 *   explicit claim or by omission.  Since few users ever read sources,
 *   credits must appear in the documentation.
 * 
 * - Altered versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
 *   misrepresented as being the original software.  Since few users ever read
 *   sources, credits must appear in the documentation.
 * 
 * 2) The executables (the .exe files in DOS) are for sale and can not be
 *    freely distributed (with the exception of the beagle.exe file).
 *    Executables (binaries) on any platform (Unix, Mac, Amiga, DOS, etc.)
 *    can not be freely distributed.
 * 
 * The executables (the .exe files in DOS) are copyrighted, all rights
 * reserved.  You should treat this software just like a book.  This means
 * that this software (the executables) may be used by any number of people
 * and may be freely moved from one computer to another so long as the program
 * is not used by more than one person at a time.  This applies to binaries on
 * any platform.
 * 
 *   The following provisions also apply in both cases 1 and 2: 
 * 
 * - Virtual Life and the authors are not responsible for the consequences of
 *   use of this software, no matter how awful, even if they arise from flaws
 *   in it.
 * 
 * - Neither the name of Virtual Life, nor the authors of the code may be used
 *   to endorse or promote products derived from this software without
 *   specific prior written permission.
 * 
 * - The provision of support and software updates is at our discretion.
 * 
 * Please contact Tom Ray (full address below) if you have questions or would
 * like an exception to any of the above restrictions.
 * 
 * If you make changes to the code, or have suggestions for changes,
 * let us know!  If we use your suggestion, you will receive full credit
 * of course.
 * 
 * THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ``AS IS'' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
 * WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
