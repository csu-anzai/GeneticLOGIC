4) Bug Fix

template search - Version 3.11 and earlier had a bug in the bi-directional
     template search algorithm.  God intended that the search should move
     outward at equal rates in both directions.  However, some situations
     caused one direction to get ahead of the other.  This does not matter
     to the creatures or evolution; evolution makes due with whatever
     physics or chemistry it has at hand.  However, it makes it difficult
     for the observer reading the genome files to tell what the outcome of
     a bi-directional template search might be.  Another problem with the
     same algorithm is that the limit on the distance of the template
     search was not properly implemented, they tend to search farther than
     the intended limit.  Both these bugs are fixed in V3.12.

5) Resolution Toggle

     In V3.12 on DOS machines with a VGA display, the simulator will come
up in low resolution mode.  If you select a histogram or size list display,
it will toggle into high resolution mode.  When you return to the plan
display, it will toggle back into low resolution mode.  This is easier
on the eyes.

6) Future Phylogeny

     At the moment, the primary effort in new code development is dedicated
to an extension to the genebanker that will produce an ironclad phylogeny.
The requires that we trace the genetic source of every instruction written
into every creature.  Stay tuned.
