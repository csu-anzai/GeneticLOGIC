DGENESIS is a distributed implementation of a Parallel Genetic Algorithm.
It is based on John Grefenstette's GENESIS 5.0. Each subpopulation is
handled by a UNIX process and communication between them is handled
with Berkeley sockets.

DGENESIS has been tested on DECstations 5000, microVAXen 3100, Sun
workstations and PCs running 386BSD 0.1. Porting to other systems using
the Berkeley socket interface should be easy.

The user can set the migration rate, the migration interval and the
topology of communication between subpopulations.

The documentation is in subdirectory doc in PostScript and ascii
formats. Read the documentation for installation procedures and
operation of DGENESIS.

Comments on the system and bug reports are welcomed. 

If you want to be added to DGENESIS user's list, please send me a
e-mail message to the address listed above. I'll send changes/upgrade 
information to people on this list.


----------------------------------------

Known problems:

1 - If you get an "Interrupted system call" message you can safely
    ignore it. It is a select function call in migrate.c that will be
    repeated.
