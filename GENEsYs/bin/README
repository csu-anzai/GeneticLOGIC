==============================================================================

	As usual, binaries go here:

		ga		Genetic Algorithm 
				Try: 	ga -h | more 	for online-help
		report		Report generator, automatically invoked by ga
		setup		Interactive parameterization progam for ga
		gapl		Shell scripts useful for data visualization
		gacols
	
	The file gapl is a shell script which can be used for quick visua-
	lization of the results of GA runs. In order to do so, the program
	gnuplot is needed with a special extension capable of reading from
	pipes. 
	The script gapl is used in most cases as follows:	

		gapl -d best -l <dir-name>

	Here <dir_name> is the directory where ga has placed you data in.
	-d best indicates that you want  to see the best value behaviour,
	-l creates a  logarithmic plot on  the y-axis.  You can pass more
	than one <dir_name> to the script, separated by blanks.

	gacols is used by gapl for column extraction from rpt and var files.

	You can obtain the gnuplot program by anonymous ftp from

		walhalla.germany.eu.net (192.76.144.129)

	as follows:
