The Gene Invariant Genetic Algorithm - a prototype demonstration
program.  The purpose for making this available is to allow readers of
the technical report TR92-05 to verify the experiments and check the
robustness over parameter variations.

Last updated:
 Jan 22/93 - code added to free memory allocated in initpop().

To obtain, copy the SHAR.Z file, 
uncompress SHAR.Z
unshar SHAR.Z
cd Source
make
cd ../Experiments
mv ../Source/giga .
giga <Decept/goldberg.1

In the last step the input file can be replaced by any of the 
files, or take input from the standard input.
