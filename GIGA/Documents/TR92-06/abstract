Abstract:

This document describes the gene invariant genetic algorithm (GIGA)
program.  This program represents a unique approach to designing GAs
with many interesting results.  The primary distinguishing feature is
that when a pair of offspring are created and chosen as worthy of
membership in the population, they replace their parents.  In the
absence of mutation, this has the effect of maintaining the original
genetic material over time, although it is reorganized, and hence the
``invariant'' in the name.

The source code for the GIGA program, written in the programming
language C, is available on line.  This document explains how to use
this program and describes the inputs.  It also discusses the design
philosophy and indicates several possibilities for future extensions
and variations.
