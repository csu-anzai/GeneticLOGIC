	* HOW TO CONFIGURE CFS-C 1.98j?

   Well, running a C-shell you'd say: "configure --<your-os-type>", e.g.
"configure --sunos". All this command actually does, is copying the
appropriate ".cf" file from within the "config" folder into the "src"
folder, while renaming it to "src/config.h". Thus, on a non-unixoid
system, e.g. MS-DOG you can do the same with: "copy config\dos.cf
src\config.h". It's really that easy.

   Currently available ".cf" files are:

 * Atari TOS 2.x: tos.cf (configure --tos)
 * MS-DOS/PC-DOS/ANY-DOS: dos.cf (configure --dos),
 * Unix System V: sys5.cf (configure --sys5)
 * BSD Unix: bsd.cf (configure --bsd)
 * SunOS/Solaris 1.x: sunos.cf (configure --sunos)

   If your system is not supported (e.g. VMS/AmigaOS/MacOS etc.)
you have to provide your own; anyway it's really straigtforward,
so just take a look at any of the given ".cf" files, and you'll
immediately see what's going on. If you've written such a new file,
or patched an existent one, please let me know. Any contribbutions
will be greatly appreciated.
