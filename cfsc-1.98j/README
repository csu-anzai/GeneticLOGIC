CFS-C 1.98j
-----------

   CFS-C 1.98j is a slightly modified version of Rick Riolo's original
CFS-C 1.02 system. The original is included in the folder labeled "orig"
on the topmost level in the distribution of this package. (For a complete
OVERVIEW refer to the file of the same name on the top level, after
unpacking.)

   Objectives of the modifications were three:

(1) I wanted to get a feel for this package, because I am working on my
own implemenation of a CFS called JAZZ-C (pronounced [:jazzy]); and
already had implemented SCS-C, Goldberg's Simple Classifier System; thus
I wanted to take a look at the state-of-the-art implementation.

(2) It should look like any freeware UNIX package with the usual conventions.
[Well, being a long time unix hacker and thus felt that the "PC outfit" doesn't
make CFS-C look like any state-of-the-art. I thus converted the file
structure according to good old-fashioned UNIX conventions; i.e. there's
a genarl purpose classifier-routine library "libCFS.a", which is linked
against the special purpose environment, you can configure the package for
various platforms without the struggle it takes with the original version,
etc.] See the CONFIGME file for more on configuration of the package.

(3) It should run through at least two ANSI-C compilers; for testing I
used GNU GCC (gcc version 2.4.3) and SUN's acc (SC1.0, 1Mar1991); but
should remain compilable by "pure" K&R C compilers (bundled Sun-C
compiler on SunOS 4.1.x).

   NOTE: Rick Riolo wrote in his SAB90 paper that he were about to release
CFS-C v2.0, which were to be an "ansified" version of 1.0 but now, Oct '93
he hopes to come out with with a CFS-C++ in 1994/95. Until this time, 1.98j
will be the only ANSI-C alternative; at least the only one, that we know of.
