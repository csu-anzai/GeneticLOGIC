SGA-C is a C-language translation and extension of the original
Pascal SGA code presented in Goldberg's text (Goldberg, 1989). 
It has some additional features, but its operation is 
essentially the same as that of the original, Pascal version. 
A technical report (in PostScript file sga-c.ps) 
is included as a concise introduction 
to the SGA-C distribution. It is presented with the assumptions that 
the reader has a general understanding of Goldberg's original Pascal SGA 
code, and a good working knowledge of the C programming language.
The report begins with an outline of the files included in the SGA-C
distribution, and the routines they contain. 
The outline is followed by a discussion of significant features of SGA-C
that differ from those of the Pascal version.
The report concludes with a discussion of routines that must be altered to
implement one's own application in SGA-C.


The authors are interested in the comments, criticisms, and bug reports
from SGA-C users, so that the code can be refined for easier use in 
subsequent versions. Please email your comments to
