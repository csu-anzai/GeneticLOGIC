Oslo 13 May 1994

This is an implementation of Conway's game of Life, written in
Borland Pascal, with all the speed-critical stuff in assembler.

It currently performs about 120-140 generations/second on a
486-33, with an array of 200x200 cells, which equates to about
5-6 cycles/cell generation.

My main idea is that I store all the information about two cells
plus all the neighbours, in a single byte, and always process
16 bits at a time, updating four cells simultaneously.

This is copyrighted (c) but free software.  I only ask that you send
email listing any improvements/modifications you come up with.
