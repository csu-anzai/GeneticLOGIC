# GAhosts - the host table used by GAucsd to distribute simulations.
# The base table in $GAUCSD/usr can be overridden by a user-specific
# table "~/GAhosts" which in turn yields to "GAhosts" in the current
# directory.  Each entry should have the format:
#
# <load factor> <host name> [<login> [<directory>]]
# eg. "1 neuromancer smith /data/GAucsd"
#
# For binary compatible hosts the directory may coincide with the
# current directory through disk sharing (in which case redundant
# copies will be avoided) or even be omitted (in which  case  the
# executable  will be run in /tmp).  If the login is also omitted
# it will default to $USER.  Add entries below:
