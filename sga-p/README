(*  DESCRIPTION								*)
(*	This is the SGA code from Appendix C of Goldberg's book 	*)
(*	"Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimisation & Machine		*)
(*	Learning" minus the comments (I couldn't be bothered		*)
(*	typing them in).						*)
(*									*)
(*	It appears to be a working version but don't quote me		*)
(*	on that	since I pulled it out of archive in response to		*)
(*	requests for it on the net -- I actually typed it in over	*)
(*	18 months ago so my memory is rather hazy as to what it		*)
(*	was even supposed to do.					*)
(*									*)
(*  NOTE								*)
(*	Note that the Turbo Pascal PC compiler (Borland Int'l) is	*)

(*  CHANGES								*)
