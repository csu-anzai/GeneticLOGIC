These are the defaults specified in Holland's challenge:

Blocksize (int) 8     Number of bits in a block
Gapsize (int)   7     Number of irrelevant bits between consecutive blocks
m* (int)        4     Up to this many bits in a low-level block gets reward
u* (double)     1.0   First block in any higher level earns this
u (double)      0.3   Later blocks in any higher level earns this
v (double)      0.02  Reward/penalty per bit in low-level blocks

Note that Holland specifies a number of levels (k) rather than a
gapsize, so that there are two-to-the-k blocks at the lowest level.

This file is read by pga when you specify -err for Royal Road functions.
It looks for numbers in this file, in the order and of the types shown
above. Non-numeric text is just ignored.
