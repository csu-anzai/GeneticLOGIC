SCS-C:
-----

   SCS-C is a (`mostly ANSI') C language translation and extension
of Goldberg's Simple Classifier System, as presented in Appendix D
in his seminal book "Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and
Machine Learning", Addison-Wesley, Reading MA, 1989.

   SCS-C has been developed in parallel on a Sun4 10/30 and an ATARI ST,
and thus should be quite portable. It is also configurable (1) for the
operating system you're running, and (2) the compiler you're using.
Refer to the documentation on how to configure SCS-C for your needs.

   SCS-C is distributed free of charge and the other terms of the GPL, ie.
the GNU General Public License. Included are some additional goodies,
e.g. the VAX/VMS version of SCS. Rewritten in C by Erik Mayer
<emayer@uoft02.utoledo.edu> (see contrib/vax-scs/*), some random
number generators (see contrib/plauger/*, contrib/knuth/*, contrib/vlcr/*),
and a short paper (docs/repro.*) that reproduces the results from Chapter 6
of Goldberg's book, and explains, why the generated figures of SCS-C
simply cannot resemble the printed exactly. Some parts of the distribution
are therefore "individually copyrighted", ie. by other authors, and
are protected by the COPYLITE protection scheme. Refer to the file
of the same name, that comes with the source distribution.

   SCS-C v0.99j is available via ftp from lumpi.informatik.uni-dortmund.de
(129.217.36.140).  Log in with user name "ftp" and give your full e-mail
address as password.  The file scs-c-0.99j.tar.gz in directory /pub/LCS/src
contains the complete software distribution; the documentation alone
is available as scs-c-doc.tar.gz in directory /pub/LCS/docs.
(You will need the GNU gzip/gunzip packages to uncompress the file(s)).
