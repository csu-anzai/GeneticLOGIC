	* WHATZ COPYLITE?

   Copyright in a virtual medium is something very hard to define and/or
persue. In general you should treat this book as you would treat any other
book, with the following exceptions:

 * if you think an information given in this guide is partially invalid or
   simply wrong, rewrite the paragraph(s) and send them to the Texinfo
   editor/coordinator. Notes of this kind are greatly appreciated even
   if you cannot provide a rewritten paragraph, just tell what you think
   is wrong.

 * if you think information is omitted and/or must be provided on
   subjects not yet discussed herein, no problem, drop the current
   Texinfo editor/coordinator your new Texinfo @node and it will
   be included in future releases.

   These ideas are not that brandnew, usually this is what happens to
FreeWare software packages, posted to The Net. But as time goes by and
MultiMedia and electronically available texts (e-text) become more and
more common, these give-aways are also well-suited for distribution
under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (GPL). Anyway, there's a subtle
but intriguing difference between software pieces and electronically
available texts, i.e. a text "implements" it's authors view, and thus
changing it would immediately "fake" it's contents.

We conclude that there must be a facility to INDIVIDUALLY COPYRIGHT "pieces"
of e-texts, such that reflected opinions CANNOT be changed, unless these
changes are approved by the original author(s).
I therefore call the protection scheme COPYLITE, right after the traditional
COPYRIGHT, and the GNUish COPYLEFT protection schemes.

   THE TERMS OF THE GPL APPLY TO THIS TEXINFO PACKAGE WITH A SINLGE BUT
SIGNIFICANT EXCEPTION: YOU MUSN'T CHANGE THE INDIVIDUALLY COPYRIGHTED PARTS
OF THE BIG DUMMY'S GUIDE TO THE INTERNET! THESE ARE AS FOLLOWS:
