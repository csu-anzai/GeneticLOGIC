Hints to include the Evolution Machine (EM) in the AI Repository and
                             CD-ROM of the CMU

1. Copyrights

   The EM software is a (free of charge) product of Hans-Michael Voigt,
   Joachim Born  and Jens Treptow.  The authors developed the EM at the
   Institute for Informatics and Computing Techniques of Berlin.
   At present, Hans-Michael Voigt and Joachim Born are at the Technical
   University of Berlin.

3. Distribution kit

   We provide  the EM-software in object code,  which can be run on PC's
   with MS--DOS and Turbo C,v2.0,  resp. Turbo C++,v1.01.  The Manual to
   the EM is included in the distribution kit.


4. Brief description

   The Evolution Machine (EM)  is  universally applicable  to continuous
   (real-coded) optimization problems.

   In the EM,  we have coded  fundamental  evolutionary algorithms,  and
   added some of our approaches to evolutionary search.

   The EM includes extensive menu techniques with:

         * Default parameter setting for unexperienced users.
         * Well-defined entries for  EM- control by freaks of
           the EM,  who want  to leave  the standard  process
           control.
         * Data processing for repeated runs (with or without
           change of the strategy parameters).
         * Graphical presentation of results:
           online presentation of the evolution progress, one-,
           two- and three-dimensional graphic output to analyse
           the fitness function and the evolution process.
         * Integration of calling MS--DOS utilities (Turbo C).

5. Keywords

      Evolutionary Algorithms, Evolution Strategies, Genetic
      Algorithms
