 Fall, 1990

 I moved the psedu-random number generator source from utility.c to cfsrand.c



 25 Feb 1991

 Add necessity auction to system:
 BBType	Meaning
 0		std
 1		pay for all matching messages (not just those used to produce a message)
 2		sysrew biased by k
 3		goldberg's vsb

 AllPayBd
 0		Std
 1		pay for all messages produced (even if conflict resolution deleted some)
 2		pay average (holyoak etal approach)
 3		goldberg's necessity auction (pay second highest bid)

 But how to do NA when there are multiple winners and bidders?
